### Creating Issues

#### Asking questions

It's very easy, just create an issue wtih the title in the form of a question and a description with more details about your question.

Before creating ones, please check [this list](https://github.com/cuscuz-flag/cuscuz-flag/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

#### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are a reality in software. We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file it anyway.

Before reporting a bug, please search existing issues and pull requests, as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. In the odd case that you find your issue as fixed/closed, please add a reference to it on your new one.

Your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code simple that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.
